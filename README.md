# Projects

My main goal is become a really good low-level engineer, focus on C/C++ language, Shell Script,
Firmware and Kernel Engineering and finally Linux programmer. I will list a few of my projects below.


## C/C++ Based projects

### [Swarm Engine](https://github.com/Beloin/SwarmEngine)

> C, Linux and OpenGL

Swarms are naturally observed in insects and animals, where the individual activity are suppressed by the group will. Here I implemented a small Swarm engine using OpenGL (Graphics Computer API), GLFW and GLAD to copy and simulate the swarm behaviour.

### [2DPhysicsSimulator](https://github.com/Beloin/2DPhysicsSimulator)

> C

A small Physics engine implemented in C. Used in the Swarm Engine to act as the main engine.

## Embedded Projects

### [Simple Weather Station With Raspberry PI](https://github.com/Beloin/WeatherStation)

In this project, was implemented again a Simple Weather Station, but now using Rasberry PI as controller and programming in C++ again using CMake. In order to run both in Linux system and Raspberry PI, it was created conditional compilation to achieve "portable" code to ease the tests.

### [PIC16 PI Controller](https://github.com/Beloin/PID_Controller_PIC16)

A DC-DC Converter using PIC16 MCU to hold the voltage to desired output.

### [Simple Weather Station with ESP32](https://github.com/Beloin/WeatherStation)

In this project, we show a simple Weather Application, using ESP32 and OLED. A simple OLed display shows the current temperature and the humidity using the DHT11 sensor and the attached button works as the user interaction to the application. Where I used interruptions, button deounce and third-party APIs to help me develop this simple embedded project.
