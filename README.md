# Projects

My main goal is become a really good low-level engineer, focus on C language, Shell Script, Embedded Engineering and OS perks. I will list a few of my projects below.


## C Based projects

### [Swarm Engine](https://github.com/Beloin/SwarmEngine)

Swarms are naturally observed in insects and animals, where the individual activity are suppressed by the group will. Here I implemented a small Swarm engine using OpenGL (Graphics Computer API), GLFW and GLAD to copy and simulate the swarm behaviour.
